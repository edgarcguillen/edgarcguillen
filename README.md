<h1>Hi, I’m Edgar!</h1>

<h2>I’m an instrument of change, driven by wonder, possibility, and the hope to make things better.</h2> 

Lazy Sunday mornings, mexican food, coffee, homemade pancakes, a cold IPA, and my mom's bad ass fish tacos are a regular must.

I have a curious personality and enjoy the process of learning and developing new skills.

You can find some of my work at my personal blog, [theKindhustle](https://thekindhustle.com), where I write about leading and launching ideas from the heart.
